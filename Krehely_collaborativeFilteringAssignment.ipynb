    "The goal of this exercise is to guide you through the implementation of collaborative filtering using matrix factorization and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By the end of this exercise, students will have a working collaborative filtering system that predicts user ratings for movies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Understanding Collaborative Filtering:\n",
    "Description: Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems that predicts user preferences based on past interactions. It relies on the idea that users with similar preferences in the past will likely have similar preferences in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: Research the concept of collaborative filtering and explain the difference between user-based and item-based filtering.\n",
